<h1>iaq</h1>

<p>The first startup I ever joined was called Innovative Air Quality.  Our goal was to create a low cost, remote sensor monitoring platform capable of accepting input from a large variety of environmental sensors, warehouse the data, and allow users to interact with the system in through a web interface.

<p>I was the first technical person to join the project and it was my responsibility to formalize the specifications as given by the founder and build the prototype.  Since we were positioning the product to compete on price, it was essential that the system was constructed from off-the-shelf components for which we could secure volume discounts.

<p>The system I came up with, shown in the photos below, consists of three primary components: an analog to digital converter (ADC), a power supply and a supervisory computer.  In the end, the system was capable of all the core functionalities of our competitors, except for a self contained UPS system, for about 50 times less the price of our competitors.

<p>Below are a few images showing the prototype I built and the production version which we had built for us.
